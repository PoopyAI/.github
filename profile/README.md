[PoopyAI](https://www.poopyai.com) is an innovative platform currently in its beta stage of development, making it an exciting and rapidly evolving project within the field of AI. While it may not have gained widespread popularity just yet, its unique offerings and commitment to providing free AI models for public use have garnered attention from enthusiasts and researchers in the AI and machine learning community.

One of the main highlights of PoopyAI is its collection of diverse AI models, including the mostly used Poopygpt text generator. Within this category, users can access different versions of the Poopygpt model, such as Poopygpt 2.0, 1.6, and 1.5. Each iteration brings its own set of capabilities and improvements, allowing users to experiment and explore various AI-generated text outputs. Additionally, PoopyAI features an interactive chatbot model called ChatPoopygpt, which enables users to engage in dynamic conversations with the AI.

To cater to specific requirements, we offer users the opportunity to submit custom dataset requests. This means that if users have a particular dataset they would like to train a model on, they can contact the site's administrator via email to discuss their needs. Moreover, we provide users with the option to request a custom model or an API key, opening up further possibilities for personalized AI experiences.

It's worth noting that PoopyAI distinguishes between its Long Term Support (LTS) models and legacy projects. LTS models are actively maintained and updated, ensuring that users receive ongoing support. On the other hand, legacy projects are no longer actively updated and may eventually be phased out. This clear differentiation allows users to make informed decisions based on their preferences and requirements.

Despite its light-hearted and somewhat unconventional name, PoopyAI represents a serious and valuable tool for individuals interested in exploring the potential of AI and machine learning. With its expanding collection of AI models, customizable options, and commitment to supporting users' needs, PoopyAI aims to foster innovation and facilitate the integration of AI technologies into various domains. As the platform continues to evolve and refine its offerings, it is poised to make a significant impact within the AI community.

Currently, we ([and you!](https://github.com/PoopyAI/pgpt3-data)) are working on Poopygpt 3.0, the next generation of the Poopygpt series, it will contain a lot of training data and better speed. With the addition of data, Poopygpt 3.0 will be less limited than Poopygpt 2.0. But please do note Poopygpt 3.0 will not be in LTS (Long Term Support).
