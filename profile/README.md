PoopyAI is a platform that offers free AI models for public use. The service provides various versions of the Poopygpt text generator, including Poopygpt 2.0, 1.6, and 1.5, as well as a chatbot model called ChatPoopygpt. The platform also supports custom dataset requests for specific models. Users can request a custom model or an API key by contacting the site's administrator via email. The site distinguishes between LTS (Long Term Support) models, which receive updates, and legacy projects, which are no longer updated and may be removed in the future. Despite its playful name, PoopyAI is a serious tool for those interested in AI and machine learning.
