# PoopyAI

[PoopyAI](https://www.poopyai.com) is an innovative AI platform that is currently in its beta stage of development. It offers a range of AI models and services to users, with a focus on providing free AI models for public use. Although PoopyAI is still gaining popularity, it has garnered attention from AI and machine learning enthusiasts and researchers due to its unique offerings.

## Poopygpt Text Generator

One of the main highlights of PoopyAI is its collection of diverse AI models, with the Poopygpt text generator being the most popular one. Users can access different versions of the Poopygpt model, including Poopygpt 2.0, 1.6, and 1.5. Each iteration of the model brings its own set of capabilities and improvements, allowing users to experiment and explore AI-generated text outputs. PoopyAI also features an interactive chatbot model called ChatPoopygpt, which enables users to engage in dynamic conversations with the AI.

## Custom Dataset Requests and Custom Models

To cater to specific requirements, PoopyAI offers users the opportunity to submit custom dataset requests. Users can contact the site's administrator via email to discuss their needs and request training models on specific datasets. Additionally, users have the option to request custom models or API keys, providing personalized AI experiences.

## Long Term Support (LTS) Models and Legacy Projects

PoopyAI distinguishes between its Long Term Support (LTS) models and legacy projects. LTS models are actively maintained and updated, ensuring ongoing support for users. On the other hand, legacy projects are no longer actively updated and may be phased out in the future. This differentiation helps users make informed decisions based on their preferences and requirements.

## Poopygpt 3.0 - Next Generation

Currently, the PoopyAI team is working on Poopygpt 3.0, the next generation of the Poopygpt series. Poopygpt 3.0 will contain a larger training dataset and offer improved speed compared to its predecessors. With the addition of more data, Poopygpt 3.0 aims to be less limited in its capabilities than Poopygpt 2.0. However, please note that Poopygpt 3.0 will not be in Long Term Support (LTS).
